There are three Jupyter Notebooks used for the pre-processing of citations for a scientific report.

The input data taken from [ieeexplore.ieee.org](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org) is citations in the bibtex format. The citations has been collected in the file _all_article.bib_. This file is similar to the example below, but is significantly longer. It contains 7000+ citations.

***Jupyter Notebooks:***
- ***Ð¡ollaborators.ipynb*** - After data cleaning and preparation, it reads key pharases from the file _a_keys.txt_, then select entries containing these key phrases from the file _all_article.bib_. Then, it makes adjacency list with pairs of coatuthors and number of their common publications. The list is used to create graphs and further analytics.
- ***KeyWords.ipynb*** - It collects key phrases from _all_article.bib_, counts their number in this file, selects key phrases that are longer than one word and occur more than four times, and puts the results into a file _keycounter(key length more than 1 and number more than 4 and sorted keys).csv_
- ***articlesfinder.ipynb*** - It finds citations with keywords defined in the file _keys.txt_ among input data (_all_article.bib_) and puts them in the file _articles_for_references.bib_. There is a special field for keywords, so there is no need to use complicated techniques to detect them. The _articles_for_references.bib_ served as raw data for refrences in the laTeX project, so it is not utilized in the previous notebooks.
