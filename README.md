There are three Jupyter Notebooks used for the pre-processing of citations for a scientific report.

The input data taken from ieeexplore.ieee.org is citations in the bibtex format. The citations is collected in the file "all_article.bib". This file is similar to the example below, but is significantly longer. It contains 7000+ citations.

Jupyter Notebooks:

Ð¡ollaborators.ipynb - After data cleaning and preparation, it reads key pharases from the file "a_keys.txt", then select entries containing these key phrases from the file "all_article.bib". Then, it makes adjacency list with pairs of coatuthors and number of their common publications. The list is used to create graphs and further analytics.

KeyWords.ipynb - It collects key phrases from "all_article.bib", counts their number in this file, selects key phrases that are longer than one word and occur more than four times, and puts the results into a file "keycounter(key length more than 1 and number more than 4 and sorted keys).csv"

articlesfinder.ipynb - It finds citations with keywords defined in the file "keys.txt" among input data ("all_article.bib") and puts them in the file "articles_for_references.bib". There is a special field for keywords, so there is no need to use complicated techniques to detect them. The "articles_for_references.bib" served as raw data for refrences in laTeX project, so it is not utilized in the previous notebooks.
